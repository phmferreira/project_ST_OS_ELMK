# Project of Time Series Course - Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine with Kernels - OS-ELMK

Implementation of Online sequential extreme learning machine with kernels for nonstationary time series prediction.

In this work, an OS-ELMK was studied and coded in Octave.
To illustrate results, simulations were done with artificial and real nonstationary time series. 
Also, the ELMK was implemented for comparative analysis.
